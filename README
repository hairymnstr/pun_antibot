This is a really simple image based captcha plugin for PunBB 1.4.x

It is based on my really old Antibot plugin for PunBB 1.2.x from over 6 years ago.  It doesn't use any cookies or database tables.  This should work fine with the latest PunBB just git clone directly to your server or copy the pun_antibot folder into the extensions folder then install from the admin panel.
